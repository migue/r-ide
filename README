R-IDE is an Eclipse IDE based for the R programming language. Some of the main features are:

* Syntax highlighting
* Code completion
* Code formatting
* R projects
* Run R programs
* . . .

It is based on DLTK project right now but i am planning to migrate it to scala and the jdt weaving service. I am planning to add remote exectution support (maybe based on akka and a debugger)
