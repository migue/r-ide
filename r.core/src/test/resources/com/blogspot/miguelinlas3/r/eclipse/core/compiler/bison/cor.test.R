### ** Examples

## Hollander & Wolfe (1973), p. 187f.
## Assessment of tuna quality.  We compare the Hunter L measure of
##  lightness to the averages of consumer panel scores (recoded as
##  integer values from 1 to 6 and averaged over 80 such values) in
##  9 lots of canned tuna.

x <- c(44.4, 45.9, 41.9, 53.3, 44.7, 44.1, 50.7, 45.2, 60.1)
y <- c( 2.6,  3.1,  2.5,  5.0,  3.6,  4.0,  5.2,  2.8,  3.8)

##  The alternative hypothesis of interest is that the
##  Hunter L value is positively associated with the panel score.

cor.test(x, y, method = "kendall", alternative = "greater")
## => p=0.05972

cor.test(x, y, method = "kendall", alternative = "greater",
         exact = FALSE) # using large sample approximation
## => p=0.04765

## Compare this to
cor.test(x, y, method = "spearm", alternative = "g")
cor.test(x, y,                    alternative = "g")
